## What is the Eclipse Dash Project?

{{< incubation >}}

Project Dash is a place where the community itself can collaborate on tools for community awareness and collaboration in support of our ultimate objective of committer quality and cooperation. This is very much a research project as we are not entirely sure what these tools will be.

This is a test!

## Components
