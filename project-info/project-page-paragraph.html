Project Dash is a place where the community itself collaborates on tools for community 
awareness and collaboration in support of our ultimate objective of committer quality and 
cooperation.</p>

<p>This is very much a research project proposal as we are not entirely sure what these 
tools will be. Obviously extensions and enhancements of the dashboard are a possibility. 
Or perhaps there are add-ons to Bugzilla that could help with searching for duplicates? 
Perhaps there are mash-ups of our wiki and the ECF project that could help with 
committer awareness and collaboration? We will prototype these tools in this project 
and if they stick, we'll roll them into production on the eclipse.org or dev.eclipse.org 
website.</p>
